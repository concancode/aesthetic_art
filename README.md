Made by: COR Studios.
CONR is not fully developed if you are facing any problems or bugs please email battlekill770@gmail.com

I only made this project to challenge myself and im looking for honest feedback.
CONR was produced in Pycharm using Python Modules.
It contains the basic requirements needed for a language.
Go to the grammar.txt to review the expressions.
The language is also mostly caps. I know some people may find this annyoing and hard but I want CONR to be unique in some way.
Setting up CONR is a bit different as I said before it's not developed and doesn't have a file path yet.

1. Make sure you have Pycharm(Python IDE) installed. The reason for this is because the langauge was created with Python Modules and it does not have it's own repository yet
2. Download OR copy and paste the code from the files.
3. Before you run anything make sure that the 'shell.py' file is the main file you will be running. To do this run shell.py and then make sure you select it as the program you want to run all the time.
4. Run shell.py and in the 'Run' console type in RUN("example.txt")
5. The expected output:
    Greetings universe!
    loops, 5 poops
    loops, 5 poops
    loops, 5 poops
    loops, 5 poops
    loops, 5 poops
    0
 6. You've just ran a random language you found from somwhere(CONR)!
